## Key Features and Models
Pharmora integrates seven specialized models to assist with various aspects of bioinformatics and drug discovery:

## 1. Bioactivity Predictor (pIC50)
This model predicts the bioactivity of small molecules against specific biological targets. Using molecular descriptors and machine learning algorithms, it calculates the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (pIC50) values. This helps researchers prioritize molecules with higher predicted biological activity.

Input: Chemical structure (SMILES format or molecular file)
Output: Predicted pIC50 value

Use Case: Drug discovery campaigns seeking compounds with strong binding affinities to target proteins.

## 2. New Molecule Discovery for Specific Targets
This tool allows users to discover new molecules that are likely to interact with specific biological targets. By analyzing large compound libraries and applying similarity metrics, this model identifies novel candidates that may have therapeutic potential.

Input: Target protein identifier or structure
Output: List of potential drug-like molecules

Use Case: Early-stage drug discovery focusing on generating new leads for target proteins.

## 3. Solubility Predictor
The solubility of a drug is crucial for its absorption and distribution in the body. Pharmora’s Solubility Predictor estimates the water solubility of compounds based on their molecular structure. This helps researchers assess whether a molecule has favorable drug-like properties.

Input: Chemical structure
Output: Predicted solubility value (in mol/L)

Use Case: Screening drug candidates for formulation and bioavailability studies.

## 4. DNA Nucleotide Counter
This model analyzes DNA sequences and provides detailed nucleotide composition, helping researchers with genetic studies, molecular cloning, and sequence analysis.

Input: DNA sequence
Output: Nucleotide count (A, T, C, G)

Use Case: Genetic analysis and sequence optimization in synthetic biology projects.

## 5. Antimicrobial Activity Predictor for Peptides
With the rise of antimicrobial resistance, peptides have emerged as promising therapeutic agents. This model predicts the antimicrobial activity of peptides, helping researchers identify potential candidates for therapeutic development.

Input: Peptide sequence
Output: Predicted antimicrobial activity score

Use Case: Designing antimicrobial peptides for use in infections, wound healing, or novel therapeutics.

## 6. Molecular Descriptor Calculator
Molecular descriptors are vital for cheminformatics and QSAR (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship) studies. Pharmora's Molecular Descriptor Calculator generates a wide array of descriptors such as molecular weight, logP, polar surface area, and more.

Input: Chemical structure
Output: Comprehensive list of molecular descriptors

Use Case: Data-driven drug discovery and chemical library analysis for QSAR modeling.

## 7. Lipinski’s Rule of Five Filter
Lipinski's Rule of Five is a widely accepted guideline to evaluate drug-likeness. This model automatically filters compounds to ensure they meet these criteria, such as molecular weight, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and logP, ensuring that the compounds are likely to be orally active.

Input: Chemical structure
Output: Pass/Fail on Lipinski's Rule of Five

Use Case: Early-stage filtering of chemical libraries to focus on drug-like molecules.
